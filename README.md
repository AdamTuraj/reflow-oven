# Adam's Reflow Oven

Within this repo is my iteration for a reflow oven using PID control. The firmware will have bugs as it is meant to just work. 

## To use

Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) and import the project.

Proceed into `ReflowOven/lib/Config/config.h` and adjust the settings to your oven.

Flash to your Arduino and enjoy!
